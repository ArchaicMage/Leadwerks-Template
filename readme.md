# Leadwerks Template Project
---

## Synopsis

A clean c++ template project written around the Leadwerks API, providing an easy to use platform for interactive application development.

## Motivation

I began using Leadwerks for c++ game development in June 2013 and have been a fan ever since. Over the last few years, I have been developing a modular game architecture, providing a clean and easy to use framework for game development. The Leadwerks Template project is my aim to help streamline other c++ developers looking to enter game development with the opportunity to quickly iterate quality projects with an easy to use development pipeline.

## Versions

v0.0.4 - Complete overhaul of the template framework. Introduced AppController class. Refactored GameObject system for an Entity-Component system. Introduced Dependency Injection with Container class. Added brief documentation to all source files. Removed contents section from the readme.md. Added LuaTables++ to project. Finalized a quick sample scene to demonstrate the use of the Component system with lua scripts. Also added support for Squirrel Script though not officially supported at this time.

v0.0.3 - Added EventManager class with example event to project. 

v0.0.2 - Contains the added Game Object, Camera Manager, Input Manager and State Manager, providing a complete game-application template. This can be used if you want to start getting right into game development, without having to wire up base requirements for an application.

v0.0.1 - Contains refactored App.h and App.cpp source files, providing a complete boilerplate application. This can be used if you want to build your own application from scratch.
